Project 1: The impact of city elevation on air quality

Project Team Members:

1.	Is there a correlation in air quality between cities in the same country that have significant elevation differences?
2.	How does air quality compare within two countries of a similar nature with different elevations and populations?
3.	Is there a strong correlation between city elevation and air quality across the world?

Data Sources:
Air Quality Open Data Platform: https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/
Elevation:                      https://open-elevation.com/
Latitude-Longitude:             https://openweathermap.org/

Entire running time for the code will be around 25 minutes.
