Research questions asked:

1.	Is there a correlation in air quality between cities in the same country that have significant elevation differences?
2.	How does air quality compare within two countries of a similar nature with different elevations and populations?
3.	Is there a strong correlation between city elevation and air quality across the world?

Conclusions:

Conclusion 1: 
Comparing air quality between Delhi and Mumbai with former at significant higher elevation than Mumbai, common perception would indicate, Delhi air quality to be better than Mumbai
However, we found reverse is the case for air pollutants caused by human activity. Delhi was more polluted than Mumbai on particulate matter and carbon monoxide
There may be climactic reasons involved here

Conclusion 2:
We compared a city in China (Chengdu) with a city in India (Mumbai). Chengdu is 80% more populated than Mumbai
From our findings between Delhi and Mumbai, we were expecting higher air pollutants in Chengdu (more population and highly industrialised)
However Mumbai scored significantly higher in air pollutant than Chengdu
This result points towards human intervention in managing air pollution can lead to significant air quality improvement

Conclusion 3:
When we averaged out air pollutants across 94 countries and checked for correlations between city elevation and air pollution, results were surprising
Correlation between city elevation and air pollutants was very weak. This was contrary to expectations, namely "higher elevation" = "better air quality"

Overall conclusion
From our study we find that as development in world economy accelerates and cities at higher elevations start getting developed, risk of pollution will increase significantly.
Silver lining being human intervention can impact air quality as evidenced with Chengdu/ Mumbai comparison
This points toward increased focus to be given to developing cities at higher elevations or in the developing world more "Delhi" type polluting cities are likely to form
